# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Build a working intelligent marketplace that demonstrates understanding of complex multi-user architectures and real-time coordination
- Implement a sophisticated matching algorithm (weighted scoring) to show algorithmic thinking and optimization
- Create three purpose-built user interfaces (Dispatcher, Customer, Contractor) that work seamlessly together
- Establish end-to-end workflows that handle the complete job lifecycle: creation → assignment → completion → feedback
- Demonstrate clean code, professional architecture patterns (DDD, CQRS, event-driven), and maintainability

## Background Context

SmartScheduler is a field service marketplace that coordinates three user roles (Dispatchers, Customers, Contractors) in real-time through an intelligent matching system. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio project demonstrating:

1. **Complex Architecture**: Multi-role system with role-based access control, event-driven messaging (SignalR), and real-time coordination
2. **Business Logic Sophistication**: Weighted scoring algorithm that intelligently ranks contractors across multiple dimensions (availability, proximity, quality ratings)
3. **Full-Stack Development**: Production-grade .NET backend with React frontend, database design, API architecture, email integration
4. **UX & Usability**: Three distinct user experiences optimized for different workflows (dispatcher speed, customer transparency, contractor convenience)

The system demonstrates the ability to build enterprise-grade features: real-time notifications, multi-user coordination, transactional consistency, and graceful error handling.
