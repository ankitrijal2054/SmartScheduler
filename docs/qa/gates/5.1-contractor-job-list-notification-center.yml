notes: |
  Story 5.1 represents high-quality, production-ready implementation of the contractor job list and notification center. 

  Key Strengths:
  - Excellent component architecture and state management
  - Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking
  - Robust real-time infrastructure with reconnection logic
  - Strong security and performance optimizations
  - Full adherence to project coding standards

  Dependencies & Assumptions:
  - Backend SignalR NotificationHub must be implemented per Story 5.5 specification
  - API endpoints /api/v1/contractor/assignments expected to be ready
  - Authentication context and JWT handling assumed functional

  Enhancement Opportunities (Non-Blocking):
  - E2E testing with Playwright (deferred appropriately to later phase)
  - Mobile device testing to verify CSS responsive design
  - SignalR reconnection hook test coverage (minor gap)
  - WCAG AA focus indicators enhancement

  Recommendation: APPROVE for production. Backend team should coordinate SignalR implementation. 
  Mobile testing recommended but not blocking. Implementation demonstrates strong technical practices.
