  **Implementation Quality Highlights:**

  - All 10 tasks completed with 100% subtask coverage
  - 79 Story 4.2 tests across 6 test files, all passing
  - Full AC traceability: Visual timeline, job details, contractor info, real-time updates, status display, reassignment handling, page load refresh, mobile responsiveness
  - Production build verified: 0 TypeScript errors (after 1 minor type fix)
  - Responsive design: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)
  - Accessibility: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
  - Real-time features: SignalR integration with 30-second polling fallback

  **QA Refactoring Applied:**
  - Fixed EventListener type in signalRService.ts to properly handle Error objects
  - All 384 tests continue passing after refactoring

  **Recommendation**: Story 4.2 is production-ready and exceeds quality standards. Approve for immediate deployment.
