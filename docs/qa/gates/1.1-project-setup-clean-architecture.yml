# Recommendations (all optional improvements)
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider removing duplicate health check endpoint (minimal API vs controller)"
      refs: ["backend/SmartScheduler.API/Program.cs:45"]
      priority: low
      reason: "Minor redundancy - both endpoints work, choose one for consistency"
    - action: "Add explicit architecture rule test preventing Application → Infrastructure references"
      refs: ["backend/SmartScheduler.API.Tests/DependencyInjectionTests.cs"]
      priority: low
      reason: "Nice-to-have for explicit validation (already confirmed by build success)"

# Review summary
review_summary:
  strengths:
    - "Clean architecture with proper unidirectional dependency flow"
    - "Comprehensive exception handling with standardized error responses"
    - "16 unit tests validating all critical infrastructure"
    - "Excellent code documentation and naming conventions"
    - "SOLID principles demonstrated throughout"
  observations:
    - "Duplicate health check endpoints (minimal API + controller) - not blocking"
    - "Could add 4th DI test for architecture rules - nice-to-have"
